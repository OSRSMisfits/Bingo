This was thrown together over the course of a few days as a fun little project. Don't expect good code quality, I wrote it to work, not be pretty or maintainable

## Usage
This app is designed to be deployed without cost, thus it does not technically have a back-end.
The idea is to deploy the static front-end through GitHub Pages, and use Google Sheets as a "database"

Why Google Sheets? It's free hosting for the small amount of data needed, its familiar to most people, and it has access control built in.

If you're reading this because you want to use this code for your own purpose.. The setup and conversion should be relatively simple, but I haven't written any guide here. Maybe in the future.

## License
This code is under the MIT license, meaning you are free to copy and use it however you wish. If you do so, I would greatly appreciate it if you kept the credit attribution intact in some way.
